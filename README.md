# Optimizing-Resoruce-Scaling-for-Network-Slicing-through-Attention-based-Forecasting
This project will build a deep learning-based forecasting model which leveraging an attention mechanism to forecast the future usage of Virtual network function instances' resources in network slices and then scale up and down the number of VNF instances based on the predicted usage
